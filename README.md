# Face-Recognition

Face Recognition system enable to identify and verify face from digital images and videos.This repository works in the same way using **face_recognition** open source liberary to compare imposter and genuine images using **true_face_distance** and identify faces using **face_matching_score**. Further bob libary is used for **Detection error tradeoff (DET)** graph plot of error rates for binary classification systems, plotting the false rejection rate vs. false acceptance rate
